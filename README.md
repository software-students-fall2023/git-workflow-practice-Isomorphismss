# An article about how to be a good programmer
There's an insightful article that provides valuable tips and standards for becoming a good programmer. You can read it by clicking [here](https://henrikwarne.com/2014/06/30/what-makes-a-good-programmer/).

## What I found interesting about the article
The author highlights five essential qualities that every proficient programmer should possess: 

*Problem Decomposition, Scenario Analysis, Effective Naming, Consistency, Continuous Learning.*

To elaborate on each, we have:
* **Problem Decomposition**: A proficient programmer can break a problem down into smaller, manageable parts, ensuring that the solution is clear, easy to implement, test, and reason about.

* **Scenario Analysis**: Good developers anticipate different scenarios in the software, including both the normal flow and unexpected events. They think like testers, constantly questioning how things might break.

* **Naming**: Effective naming of classes, methods, and variables results in self-documenting code. Itâ€™s not just about initial naming but also the ability to rename as understanding evolves.

* **Consistency**: Managing complexity in programming is crucial. Consistency in naming, structure, and methods helps reduce accidental complexity, making patterns more recognizable.

* **Learning**: The rapid pace of software development means constant learning is required. A good programmer not only learns fast but finds joy in the learning process.

As undergraduate students preparing to enter the professional world, it's imperative that we strive to become proficient programmers.
